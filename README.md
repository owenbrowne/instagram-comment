## Setup

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```

### 2. Configure the Bot

Edit `config.env` and set:

```env
# Your Instagram credentials (use a test account!)
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username_here
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Instagram post URL to comment on
POST_URL=https://www.instagram.com/p/EXAMPLE/

# Delay between comments (seconds)
# Recommended: 300-600 (5-10 minutes) minimum
MIN_DELAY=300
MAX_DELAY=600

# Comments (comma-separated)

```

### 3. Run the Bot

```bash
python instagram_bot.py
```

## Configuration Tips

### Delays
- **Minimum recommended: 5-10 minutes (300-600 seconds)**
- Shorter delays = higher risk of detection
- Longer delays = safer but slower

### Comments
- Use varied, natural-sounding comments
- Avoid spam-like repetitive text
- Mix short and long comments
- Add emojis for variety (optional)

Example:
```
COMMENTS=Love this! üòç,Great content!,This is amazing,Keep up the good work,Inspiring! ‚ú®,Wow! üî•,Beautiful post,So creative!
```

## Files Created

- `session.json` - Stores login session (keeps you logged in)
- `instagram_bot.log` - Detailed log of all bot activities

## Troubleshooting

### "Challenge Required" Error
- Instagram needs verification
- Login manually through the app first
- Complete any verification steps
- Wait a few hours before trying again

### "Feedback Required" Error
- You've been rate limited or flagged
- Stop the bot immediately
- Wait 24-48 hours
- Increase delays in config.env

### Bot Stops Commenting
- Check `instagram_bot.log` for errors
- Verify account isn't banned (try logging in manually)
- Increase delays between comments
- Use more varied comments

## Best Practices

1. **Use a test account** - Never risk your main account
2. **Start slowly** - Use longer delays at first (10-15 minutes)
3. **Monitor logs** - Check for warnings or rate limiting
4. **Vary comments** - Use 10-20 different comment variations
5. **Don't run 24/7** - Take breaks (run 2-3 hours, pause, repeat)
6. **Stop if flagged** - If you get warnings, stop immediately
